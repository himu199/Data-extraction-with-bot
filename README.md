# Data-extraction-with-bot
Here in this repository I have saved my code on extracting data with bots. I have extracted data from Instagram, the daata being either #images or any kind of images that can be searched on instagram, while on the second project I have created a bot which extracts followers info from a specified user.

Scraping_Instagram_pictures_with_bot project overview:
  * Log into Instagram profile
  * Search the specified hashtag word in the serchbox
  * Execute search
  * Scroll through the Images while saving their source codes
  * Download the images and saving them in a folder, ex- dogpictures1
  * (Info size can be easily increased by restructuring code in functions and introducing a loop)
 
 Scraping_Instagram_followers_with_bot project overview:
  * Log into Instagram profile
  * Search the specified username
  * Click on followers button
  * Iterate over a max recommended 500 followers at a time
  * Saves names in a '.txt' file,ex-followers.txt
  * (Info size can be easily increased by introducing a loop)
